Prologue

As the autumn strikes 1098's Britannia, in the kingdom of Haystone rough times and a dark plague arises.
The story begins at the forgery of Master Hyngwar and his apprentice Aethel.
His master has gone sick. Something dreadful has pushed his mind into a state of decay.

Aethel believes that this could be the GREYFEL PLAGUE. He heard this came into the town a few weeks ago,
throughout some rumors.
There is no time to waste....but also....he is uninformed about it and here his quest to find the
cause and cure to Hyngwar's illness begins.
